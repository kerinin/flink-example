         * Questions:
         * 
         * - How is a temporal join different than a vanilla join consumed as a changelog?
         * 
         *    I think the difference has to do with fixing values computed from a stream to an instant.
         *    A vanilla join A<->B produces an evolving relation between the two keys as events are added to tables.
         *    OTOH, a temporal join (A,t)<->B@t produces a relation between the tuple (A,t) and the value of key B at time t. 
         *    The result is that the value B@t doesn't change, even if new events affect the value of B.
         *    Note that both A and t may change over time, but for a _given_ tuple, B@t is constant.
         *
